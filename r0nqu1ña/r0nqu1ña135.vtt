01:07:33.647 --> 01:07:35.563
They just go,
whether the kid likes it or not.

01:07:36.188 --> 01:07:37.147
That's what parents do.

01:07:38.355 --> 01:07:40.730
Well, we both know
that's not my strong suit, Olivia.

01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:43.022
Look, if he wanted me to
go, he should have just asked me.

01:07:43.522 --> 01:07:44.730
He's vulnerable, Jack.

01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:47.355
He's a kid and he
knows you never show up.

01:07:47.813 --> 01:07:50.147
Olivia, I'm in, I'm at work.

01:07:50.563 --> 01:07:51.855
What am I supposed to do?

01:07:51.855 --> 01:07:53.480
I don't wanna have to
tell you what to do, Jack.

01:07:53.563 --> 01:07:54.897
I want you to figure it out on your own.

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:57.272
Because it's pretty
easy, the concert starts at seven.

01:07:57.647 --> 01:07:58.980
Well, I'm not gonna be home by seven.

01:07:58.980 --> 01:07:59.730
Just tell Dylan that I--

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:00.813
I'm not telling him anything.

01:08:00.897 --> 01:08:02.438
If you wanna tell him
something, do it yourself.
