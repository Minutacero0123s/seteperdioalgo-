I don't want a churro.

30:05.438 --> 30:06.147
I heard you.

30:06.438 --> 30:06.897
They're for me.

30:09.397 --> 30:10.522
So what are they saying you did?

30:10.772 --> 30:14.438
I tampered with the
school's attendance records, which I did.

30:14.772 --> 30:15.438
Allegedly.

30:16.355 --> 30:17.355
I never admit that.

30:19.188 --> 30:19.897
Thank you, have a good day.

30:19.897 --> 30:20.313
Yeah, yeah.

30:24.772 --> 30:27.605
The music teacher leaves his
computer open during fifth period.

30:27.813 --> 30:28.355
Mm-hmm.

30:28.605 --> 30:30.855
I started to ditch science so
I could go in and practice guitar.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.480
Then I changed it on the computer.

30:32.813 --> 30:33.272
Makes sense.
