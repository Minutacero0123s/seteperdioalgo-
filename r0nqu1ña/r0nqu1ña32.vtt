16:09.605 --> 16:12.022
Welcome back, Chief. What did I miss?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.063
Nothing. Everyone's working.

16:15.022 --> 16:16.355
There's a bottleneck in Rivens.

16:16.813 --> 16:19.313
Phil is blaming rapping.
Rapping says Phil's being over-dramatic.

16:19.938 --> 16:20.938
Everybody's feeling the heat.

16:21.605 --> 16:22.688
All right. I'll talk to him.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.897
Please. Phil's driving everybody nuts.

16:26.522 --> 16:28.313
Phil in Rivens is
having a total meltdown.

16:28.647 --> 16:32.105
Maybe it's time to find a less
stressful spot for Phil. I don't know. Tinsel?

16:32.730 --> 16:33.772
Phil out of Rivens?

16:34.147 --> 16:34.688
Just a thought.

16:35.230 --> 16:36.480
He's got a dog named Rivens.

16:37.147 --> 16:37.897
Yeah, thanks.

16:38.730 --> 16:44.147
495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500.
