02:38.605 --> 02:40.188
Jack, these are presents, yes.

02:40.772 --> 02:41.772
But these aren't Santa's presents.

02:42.147 --> 02:45.147
Right, because Santa
Claus hasn't been here yet.

02:45.438 --> 02:46.230
It's Christmas Eve.

02:46.688 --> 02:47.605
He's coming tonight.

02:48.855 --> 02:49.897
He's coming here.

02:50.688 --> 02:51.480
To this house.

02:52.105 --> 02:52.272
Tonight.

02:53.272 --> 02:54.272
That's what you're telling me.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.397
That's what I'm telling you.

02:55.605 --> 02:58.688
And he's also going to
every other house in the world,

02:59.105 --> 03:02.272
on the same night, using
flying reindeer for transportation.

03:03.480 --> 03:03.855
Yes, Jack.

03:04.397 --> 03:06.813
And what fuels a flying reindeer exactly?
