48:37.522 --> 48:38.438
364 days?

48:38.438 --> 48:39.522
We have boxing there, off.

48:42.855 --> 48:45.272
Wouldn't it be easier
if you broke it up, you know?

48:45.272 --> 48:47.230
Like send different
teams out different places,

48:47.230 --> 48:47.855
just more efficient?

48:48.522 --> 48:49.480
No, it doesn't work like that.

48:49.855 --> 48:51.063
He's got to do it all himself.

48:51.105 --> 48:52.897
He doesn't have to, it's his purpose.

48:53.438 --> 48:54.897
He's a singular force in the universe.

48:55.272 --> 48:56.897
Okay, so worst case scenario,

48:56.897 --> 48:58.647
is there someone
that can step in for him,

48:58.647 --> 48:59.522
like a Vice Santa?

48:59.563 --> 49:00.855
Are you listening to me?

49:01.188 --> 49:03.230
No, no one can do what he does.

49:03.480 --> 49:04.688
He knows when you're sleeping,

49:04.980 --> 49:06.105
he knows when you're awake,

49:06.313 --> 49:09.480
and he knows that about
every single person on this planet.
