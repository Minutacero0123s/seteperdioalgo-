01:22:39.397 --> 01:22:44.105
Do you know yeah? I mean you strike
me as a guy that likes to have a good time

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:49.022
Bit of a gambler well
so am I now when we came in

01:22:49.022 --> 01:22:51.688
here my man told me
that he thought he could beat you

01:22:51.688 --> 01:22:52.730
at your game

01:22:54.397 --> 01:22:54.938
Krampus laugh

01:22:54.938 --> 01:22:59.522
Now initially I said no way

01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:01.938
But the more I see
him getting riled up. I'm

01:23:01.938 --> 01:23:04.980
starting to like my
odds, so just hear me out

01:23:05.855 --> 01:23:06.480
if you win

01:23:07.147 --> 01:23:09.772
We go to your dungeon forever if he wins
