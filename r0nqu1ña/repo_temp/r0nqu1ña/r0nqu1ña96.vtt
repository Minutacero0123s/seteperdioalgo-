48:06.730 --> 48:07.397
It's a big job.

48:07.938 --> 48:08.938
Sure, sure.

48:12.272 --> 48:13.272
It's one day though, right?

48:14.772 --> 48:16.188
Like it's a big job for one day.

48:16.313 --> 48:20.688
We work 364 days a
year because on that one day,

48:20.688 --> 48:24.147
we deliver presents to
several billion individual domiciles

48:24.480 --> 48:27.813
across 37 time zones
without ever being detected

48:28.188 --> 48:29.438
by a single human being.

48:29.647 --> 48:32.772
We prep, we rehearse
every moment, every stop,

48:32.772 --> 48:33.980
down to the last chimney.

48:33.980 --> 48:35.522
So yeah, it's a lot of work.
