01:05:38.397 --> 01:05:40.230
Couple of abjurations in Nairobi,

01:05:40.813 --> 01:05:43.188
handful of divinations
in Santiago and New Orleans.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:44.022
No, she's a conjurer.

01:05:44.772 --> 01:05:47.563
Got a pair of
conjurations eight days ago,

01:05:47.772 --> 01:05:48.605
a few hours apart.

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:51.147
Picked up the echo
off the resonator in Germany.

01:05:52.522 --> 01:05:52.772
The brother.

01:05:54.313 --> 01:05:54.813
Who's brother?

01:05:55.438 --> 01:05:55.647
Nix.

01:05:56.063 --> 01:05:56.772
Santa's got a brother?

01:05:57.272 --> 01:05:58.063
He got it, yes.

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:00.397
She's working with the brother.

01:06:00.563 --> 01:06:01.605
We don't know that.

01:06:01.605 --> 01:06:03.355
No, but can you think
of a better place to hold Nick?

01:06:03.772 --> 01:06:04.522
Think about it.

01:06:04.522 --> 01:06:05.647
It's under a concealment dome

01:06:05.813 --> 01:06:07.772
and Mora has no
jurisdiction because of the treaty.

01:06:08.188 --> 01:06:09.855
He doesn't leave and we don't visit.
