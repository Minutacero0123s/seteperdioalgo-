40:07.522 --> 40:09.147
And you think I had
something to do with it?

40:09.605 --> 40:10.188
Where is he?

40:12.230 --> 40:12.730
(thunder rumbling)

40:13.772 --> 40:14.188
Is that him?

40:16.022 --> 40:18.188
Jack the Wolf
O'Malley, meet Callum Drift,

40:18.813 --> 40:20.355
commander of the ELF.

40:21.813 --> 40:22.772
The ELF?

40:22.855 --> 40:24.355
Turns out Jack here
didn't know what he was doing.

40:24.897 --> 40:26.563
Somebody hired him to find the complex,

40:26.563 --> 40:27.730
and incredibly, he did.

40:28.688 --> 40:29.563
Who? He doesn't know.

40:30.188 --> 40:30.688
I don't know.

40:30.980 --> 40:31.813
Yes, he does.

40:31.813 --> 40:32.480
No, he doesn't.

40:32.772 --> 40:34.022
They always know something.

40:35.230 --> 40:36.897
Sometimes you just
gotta shake it out of them.
