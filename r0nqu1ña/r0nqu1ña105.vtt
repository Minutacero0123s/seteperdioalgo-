52:36.813 --> 52:37.855
This is all fascinating.

52:37.855 --> 52:39.522
How about we find the
guy we're actually looking for?

52:40.397 --> 52:41.772
That's the guy we're looking for.

52:43.605 --> 52:45.438
The Carmanians are a security detail.

52:45.897 --> 52:46.230
You sure?

52:46.980 --> 52:47.272
I'm sure.

52:48.022 --> 52:49.022
We'll have a few drinks,

52:49.605 --> 52:51.397
paint some nails and
see what the afternoon's in.

52:51.397 --> 52:52.980
Hey, wait, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

52:53.230 --> 52:54.188
Going to talk to him.

52:54.230 --> 52:56.772
No, no, we gotta go in sideways here.

52:57.188 --> 52:58.563
Remember when I said
they're called death marks?

52:59.688 --> 53:00.147
We'll be fine.

53:04.230 --> 53:08.272
(dramatic music)
